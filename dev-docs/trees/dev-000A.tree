\title{Backend design}

\subtree{
\title{Concepts and overview}

\p{The main pieces of state in the backend are the SQL [database](dev-000B) and
an in-memory hash map from [refs](dev-000D) to Automerge [document
handles](https://automerge.org/docs/repositories/dochandles/). The important
thing to realize is that nothing from Automerge is persisted through a restart
of the backend; the only thing that is persisted are serializations of the
Automerge documents at different points in time. Thus, when the server restarts,
clients must request new document handles. (Currently, this is not implemented:
you must refresh the client after a server restart.)}

\p{With this in mind, we outline the database schema and the operations
currently supported on the backend.}

\title{Capabilities of the backend}

\p{The backend has the following current and future capabilities.}

\p{\strong{Currently implemented RPC API:}}

\ul{
\li{\strong{Mutation}: \code{new_ref(content: any): string}. Creates a new
[ref](dev-000D) with the given initial content. Returns the ID of the newly
created ref as a string representation of the UUID.}

\li{\strong{Query}: \code{doc_id(ref_id: string): string}. Returns the Automerge
document ID associated with the given ref. If the hash map in the backend
doesn't contain an association for that ref, then a fresh document handle is
created with initial state given by the current autosave for that ref.}

\li{\strong{Query}: \code{head_snapshot(ref_id: string): any}. Gets the content
of the current head of a ref. The result is a plain JSON object, not a live
Automerge document.}

\li{\strong{Mutation}: \code{save_snapshot(ref_id: string, content: any)}. Saves
the ref with the given content, as described in [refs](dev-000D).}
}

\p{\strong{API to implement in the future:}}

\ul{
\li{Searching for refs via their metadata.}
\li{Displaying all of the snapshots for a ref, sorted by timestamp.}
}
}
}

\title{Implementation}

\p{The backend consists of two services running in independent processes
(possibly on different machines).

\ol{
\li{\strong{Web server}, written in Rust}
\li{\strong{Automerge document server}, written in TypeScript and running in Node}
}

The services communicate bidirectionally using [SocketIO](https://socket.io/), a
simple protocol that extends WebSockets with niceties such as automatic
reconnection and message acknowledgments.}

\subtree{
\title{Dependencies}

\p{Without attempting to be exhaustive, we summarize the backend's most
important dependencies.}

\p{\strong{Web server} uses the crates:

\ul{

\li{[\code{axum}](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum): web application framework
built on the popular [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) stack}

\li{[\code{rspc}](https://www.rspc.dev/) with its \code{rspc-axum} integration:
generates a type-safe RPC client for the frontend}

\li{[\code{sqlx}](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx): type-safe queries for
Postgres (and other SQL databases)}

\li{[\code{socketioxide}](https://github.com/Totodore/socketioxide): Rust
implementation of a SocketIO server}

}}

\p{\strong{Automerge document server} uses the packages:

\ul{

\li{[\code{automerge-repo}](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo/):
Manages the websocket-based syncing of Automerge documents. Note that we do
\em{not} use its storage facilities. That's what the database is for. We would
prefer to use
[\code{automerge-repo-rs}](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo-rs), the
Rust implementation of the protocol, but at the time of this writing it is not
stable. That's why this service is written in TypeScript instead of Rust.}

\li{[\code{express}](https://expressjs.com/): The default choice of web
framework for a Node.js server. We use it only to upgrade from HTTP to the
WebSocket protocol.}

\li{\code{socket.io-client}: The official client for the SocketIO protocol.}

}}

}
}

\subtree{
\title{Infrastructure}

\p{We have an AWS server that is pointed to by the domain name backend-next.catcolab.org. This runs an instance of the backend. This backend can be used by the frontend hosted at next.catcolab.org, or by a dev server. Note that this means that PR previews only are for the frontend. So if a PR introduces significant changes to the backend, the PR preview won't see those backend changes because it will still be pointing to whatever version of the backend is running on the server. Fortunately, we don't expect the backend to change all too much, at least compared to the frontend; it just serves blobs without caring about what's in the blobs.}

\p{The system configuration of this server is configured via nix, in the \code{infrastructure/} part of the repo. In order to change the system configuration, make sure that your ssh key is enabled for root access to the server (ask Owen for this). Then run:}

\ol{
\li{\code{nix develop}}
\li{\code{deploy .#catcolab}}
}

\p{However, this will not update the version of catcolab that is running on the server. There is currently a somewhat manual process to do this, because Owen believes that it is important for people to understand the steps of the manual process so that they can debug things when they go wrong.}

\p{On backend-next.catcolab.org, there is a git clone of the catcolab repository in \code{/var/lib/catcolab}. There is a daemon (managed via systemd) that runs \code{node dist/index.js} in \code{/var/lib/catcolab/packages/backend}. In order to upgrade the version of catcolab that is running on the server, one should:}
\ol{
\li{Log in via \code{ssh root@backend-next.catcolab.org}. If you don't have access, ask Shaowei.}
\li{Use \code{su - catcolab} to become the user \code{catcolab}.}
\li{\code{cd} into \code{/var/lib/catcolab/packages/backend}.}
\li{Use \code{git} to checkout the desired version of catcolab.}
\li{Run \code{npm run build} to produce a new \code{dist/index.js} file.}
\li{Run as user root \code{systemctl stop catcolab}; this will temporarily stop the backend. It is helpful to do this in another terminal window.}
\li{Run as user catcolab in \code{/var/lib/catcolab/packages/backend} \code{npm run migrate}. This will update the database with new any migrations that have been added since the last time the database was migrated.}
\li{Run as user root \code{systemctl start catcolab}; this will start back up the backend.}
\li{(If there are no new migrations, the previous three commands can simply be accomplished via \code{systemctl restart catcolab})}
\li{You can check the status of the catcolab daemon with \code{systemctl status catcolab}, or look at the log messages with \code{journalctl -eu catcolab}.}
}

\p{To give a new user access to the servers:}
\ol{
\li{Update the public keys in \code{infrastructure/hosts/catcolab/default.nix}.}
\li{Get someone with server access to run \code{nix develop; deploy .#catcolab}.}
}

\p{To give a new user access to the secrets:}
\ol{
\li{Update the public keys in \code{infrastructure/secrets/secrets.nix}.}
\li{Get someone with secret access to run \code{nix develop; agenix -r}.}
}

\p{If you are creating an AWS instance and setting up a CatColab backend, e.g. \code{backend-next}, for the first time:}
\ol{
\li{Use the \code{nixos/24.05.3348.7e5afd404b62-x86_64-linux} community AMI.}
\li{Add 50GB of storage to the instance.}
\li{Open ports 80, 443 for HTTP, HTTPS in addition to port 22 for SSH.}
\li{Add a public key of the machine to \code{infrastructure/secrets/secrets.nix}. You can get the public keys by running \code{ssh-keyscan <machine-ip-address>}.}
\li{In the \code{namecheap} domain name hosting service, point \code{backend-next.catcolab.org} to the instance's IP address.}
\li{Log in via \code{ssh root@backend-next.catcolab.org}. If you don't have access, ask Shaowei.}
\li{Use \code{git} to clone the catcolab repo in \code{/var/lib}. Rename the directory with \code{mv CatColab catcolab} and change ownership with \code{chown -R catcolab:catcolab catcolab}.}
\li{Use \code{su - catcolab} to become the user \code{catcolab}.}
\li{\code{cd} into \code{/var/lib/catcolab/packages/backend}.}
\li{Use \code{git} to checkout the desired version of catcolab.}
\li{Run \code{pnpm install} to install dependencies.}
}

\p{Setting up the Postgres database:}
\ol{
\li{\code{su - postgres}}
\li{\code{createuser catcolab}}
\li{\code{createdb catcolab}}
\li{\code{psql}}
  \ul{
  \li{\code{alter user catcolab with encrypted password '<password>';}}
  \li{\code{grant all privileges on database catcolab to catcolab;}}
  \li{\code{ï¹¨c catcolab postgres}}
  \li{\code{grant all on schema public to catcolab;}}
  \li{\code{exit}}
  }
}
