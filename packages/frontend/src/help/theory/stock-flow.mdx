## Description

Stock-flow diagrams are the crown jewel of systems dynamics, a rich
language allowing the scientist to model a system of stocks of various quantities
and flows between them, with the rate of the flows depending in complex ways
on various stocks via *links*. 

In CatColab, we implement what we call *primitive* stock-flow diagrams, which 
do not allow for the auxiliary variables permitting flows to be arbitrary 
functions of the stocks that are characteristic in systems dynamics. 
We expect to implement this richer semantics in the future; meanwhile, 
primitive stock-flow diagrams already admit an interesting mass-action-based 
ODE semantics. 

Stock-flow diagrams are, mathematically, models of a *tabulator* theory, which gives
the first example of a theory in a double doctrine that's richer than the simple doctrine
of undecorated double categories. The presence of tabulators in the theory of stock-flow diagrams
is the reason for the possibility of drawing links, which are "level-crossing" arrows between 
flows and stocks.
